Train the network. The const. sized positive and negative
objects in the database will be read by the HOG algorithm
which is also on the hardware later. The path to the database 
must be correct.
Start /build/HOG_train
to execute the hog algorithm on the input database. The 
generated output files are the input for:
train.py
This script trains a SVM with the generated values and export
then to a cpp file "acc_classifier.cpp" These values will be
pasted in the HLS code for the detection algorithm
