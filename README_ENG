Contains  
HLS 3 projects in the folder HLS
The other 3 folders are for getting the values for the SVM

HOG_Behaviour
    is for visualizing the HOG algorithm

HOG_Capture
    The SVM need trained data wich have to be a constant size and labeled
    Therefore some data is prepared in the Database folder
    If you want to generate own positive/negative data, build the cmake
    project. After that run the python script execute.py with the correct
    path to some unlabeled picture database. A window should be open
    where you can mark the objects you want to detect.

HOG_Train
    This project takes the labeled and constant sized images adapt the HOG
    algorithm and saves the output values in a intermediate file.
    The train.py file takes this intermediate file and train ths SVM classifier
    The output of this file are the SVM weights, wich must copied in the HLS
    projects.
    More information are in the README of this project
